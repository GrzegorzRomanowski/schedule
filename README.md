# schedule
CODE IS NOT FINISHED!  -  UNDER CONSTRACTION

This is an app for creating employee schedules based on their availability.

The company employs around 60 people (mainly part-time) and has 4 to 6 workplaces with 2 work shifts each.
Every employee lists availability and preferred workplace for each month.
The app creates a ready schedule after receiving all availabilities from employees by pressing 1 or 2 buttons.

This app is an attempt to recreate the existing program used at Tri-City swimming pools.
The names of classes and variables are based on the original demand - water lifeguards assigned to their swimming pools.
